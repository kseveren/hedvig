# Perils grid component

[Check it here](http://kseveren.github.io/hedvig)

Hi! This is a test assignment for Hedvig.

To start the project, I used Create React App and also used Styled components for styles. I didn't use any special tools for state management, since this is a pretty small app.

I used basic styles from your website such as colors, typography, indents, breakpoints, and so on. I also considered using @hedviginsurance/brand, but since this was a test assignment, I decided to organize all the styles within the project myself to show my approach.

If I had more time, I would
- work on animations, error handling
- improve the modal component, add the ability to navigate through perils in an open modal window using the keyboard
- add linter+prettier

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### Thank you!
